As I am moving forward with some professional projects utilizing CircleCI, I wanted to get some practice using it. I created this repository with a simple yaml file to run my first build.

This website https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started was an awesome starting point with getting familiar with CircleCI. I would highly recommend it if you are wanting to try a new CI tool.
